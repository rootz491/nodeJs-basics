trying to store `image` as base64 String in mongodb, let's see how it'll go!

*   [stackoverflow discussion](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39711217/how-to-save-base64-directly-to-mongoose-in-express-js) on storing img in mongodb

*   [github issue thread](https://github.com/Automattic/mongoose/issues/6071) on storing in mongodb as base64.

*   article on [character set and encodings](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2003/10/08/the-absolute-minimum-every-software-developer-absolutely-positively-must-know-about-unicode-and-character-sets-no-excuses/)

*   updating array fields - pull and push - for subdoc array in my case - [here's doc](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/update/pull/)
